    Our main goal is to understand and address the global challenge of reducing obesity rates by 20\%. To do this, we're studying patterns that show how different countries manage their obesity levels. We're particularly interested in things like eating habits and how people feel about their own happiness and their country's corruption.

    In our research, we will use models to help us figure out the main factors that influence obesity. Specifically, these models not only tell us about past and current trends but also help predict the future. They are especially helpful in identifying which features or factors are most influential. Knowing the importance of features is crucial because it tells us where to focus our efforts.

    To get accurate results, models will be fine-tuned to be really good at correctly identifying true cases. This is why we prioritize the metric called "precision." The higher the precision, the more we can trust our model's predictions.

    We could use trees, linear and logistic models in our work. The linear models help us see the relationship between factors and obesity rates. In contrast, the logistic models are good at classifying whether a country's obesity rate will go above or below our 20\% target. Classification can show us the important variables.
