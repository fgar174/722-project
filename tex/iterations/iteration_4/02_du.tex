                \includegraphics[scale=1]{images/du_obesity_summary}
                \caption{}
                \label{fig:du-obesity-summary}
            \end{figure}

            \figurename~\ref{fig:du-obesity-per-obe-countries-top-lw-20} showcases two boxplots stacked vertically. The top boxplot represents the percentages of obesity in the top 20 countries with the highest prevalence, while the bottom boxplot represents the same for the 20 countries with the lowest rates of obesity. These percentages are collected over a time span from 1975 to 2016.

            \begin{figure}[H]
                \centering
                \includegraphics[scale=0.4]{images/du_obesity_pe_ob_cou_t_l_20}

                \label{fig:du-obesity-per-obe-countries-top-lw-20}
            \end{figure}

            Key takeaways from the boxplots include:

            \begin{itemize}
                \item \textbf{Top Countries:} Nauru, Cook Islands, Marshall Islands, and Palau are countries that feature prominently for having the highest obesity rates among the top 20 countries.

                \item \textbf{Bottom Countries:} On the opposite end, Vietnam and Bangladesh are among the countries with the lowest rates of obesity.

                \item \textbf{Time Frame:} The data encapsulates the years between 1975 and 2016, offering a broad historical perspective on obesity trends.
            \end{itemize}

            The juxtaposition of these two boxplots reveals striking differences in obesity prevalence across countries. It underscores the urgent need for tailored public health interventions, taking into account the unique challenges faced by countries at both ends of the obesity spectrum.

                \label{fig:du-obesity-per-obe-trend-years}
            \end{figure}

            \figurename~\ref{fig:du-obesity-per-obe-trend-years} displays a boxplot illustrating the distribution of obesity percentages from the year 1975 to 2016.

            The plots reveals several key trends and characteristics:

            \begin{itemize}
                \item \textbf{Rising Means:} The mean obesity percentage has been steadily increasing over the years. It started at approximately 5\% in 1975 and has nearly tripled to around 20\% by 2016.

                \item \textbf{Increased Variability:} The size of the boxes, which represent the interquartile range (IQR), has grown over time. This indicates an increase in data variability. Despite this increased spread, most of the data still remain in the lower part of the box, below the mean.

                \item \textbf{Presence of Outliers:} The boxplot shows outliers that reach almost 60\%. These outliers are data points that are significantly higher than the other observations and indicate instances where the obesity rates are exceptionally high.
            \end{itemize}

            The boxplot suggests that although the general trend is an increase in obesity percentages, there are significant variances and outliers that should not be overlooked. These insights are crucial for designing effective public health interventions.

            \begin{figure}[H]
                \centering
                \includegraphics[scale=0.8]{images/du_obesity_pe_ob_freq}
                \caption{Distribution of obesity percentages.}
                \label{fig:du-obesity-per-obe-distribution}
            \end{figure}

            In the histogram of percentages of obesity (\figurename~\ref{fig:du-obesity-per-obe-distribution}), the majority of the observations are clustered in the lower percentage ranges, specifically between 0\% and 5\%. This area represents the peak of the distribution. As we move towards higher percentages, the frequency of observations decreases, forming a tail on the right side of the histogram.

            This right-skewed pattern suggests that while most regions or populations have low obesity rates, there are outliers with significantly higher percentages. These outliers are responsible for the long tail on the right side of the histogram.

            The right-skewed nature of this data may have implications for public health policies, as it indicates that while obesity is generally low, there are specific areas where it is unusually high.

            \subsubsection{Statistical Summary of {\dsObesity}}

                The \textit{\dsObesity} (\figurename~\ref{fig:du-obesity-summary}) provides several statistics, calculated over a range of years from 1975 to 2016. The dataset has a total of 24,650 entries, but some columns have missing data. Here's a simple breakdown of the statistical summary:

                \begin{itemize}
                        \item \textbf{Year:} The data spans from the year 1975 to 2016, with the average year being 1995.5. The dataset is uniformly spread, as indicated by a standard deviation of 12.12.

                        \item \textbf{Numeric:} This column seems to represent some obesity metric. The minimum value is 0.1 and the maximum is 63.3. The average value is around 12.42, with a standard deviation of 10.4, indicating a wide range of data points.

                        \item \textbf{Low:} This column has a minimum value of 0 and a maximum value of 55.6. The average is 9.21, and the data varies with a standard deviation of 8.85.

                        \item \textbf{High:} The data in this column ranges from 0.2 to 70.8, with an average value of 16.20. The standard deviation is 12, suggesting variability in the data.

                        \item \textbf{StdErr and StdDev:} These columns contain no data, as all entries are missing (NaN).
                \end{itemize}

                In summary, while the dataset provides a rich set of data points for some columns like \textit{Year}, \textit{Numeric}, \textit{Low}, and \textit{High}, it lacks any information in the \textit{StdErr} and \textit{StdDev} columns.

            \subsubsection{Fields explanation}

                \begin{itemize}

                        \item \textbf{Happiness Score (Ladder):} This metric gauges individuals' subjective well-being using data from the Gallup World Poll between 2005 and 2022. Respondents assign life evaluations on a scale from 0 to 10.

                        \item \textbf{GDP Per Capita (PPP):} This feature presents economic data, accounting for purchasing power parity in constant 2017 international dollars. It combines information from the World Development Indicators (WDI) and the Penn World Table 10.01, which supplements data for certain nations.

                        \item \textbf{Healthy Life Expectancy (HLE):} Calculated from the World Health Organization's Global Health Observatory, this indicator predicts life expectancy based on health data. Interpolation and extrapolation are applied to align the range with the dataset's timeline (2005-2021).

                        \item \textbf{Social Support:} This measure captures the availability of assistance during challenging times. Respondents answer a binary question in the Gallup World Poll. Answer to the question ``If you were in trouble, do you have relatives or friends you can count on to help you whenever you need them, or not?''

                        \item \textbf{Freedom to Make Life Choices:} Reflecting personal satisfaction with individual freedom, this metric originates from GWP responses. Answer to the question ``Are you satisfied or dissatisfied with your freedom to choose what you do with your life?''

                        \item \textbf{Generosity:} Derived as a residual value from the relationship between charitable contributions and GDP per capita. Answer to the question ``Have you donated money to a charity in the past month?''

                        \item \textbf{Corruption Perception:} Extracted from GWP responses about government and business corruption, the overall perception is obtained by averaging 0-or-1 responses.

                        \item \textbf{Positive Affect:} This figure represents the average of affirmative responses to queries about positive emotions like laughter, enjoyment, and engaging activities during specific Gallup World Poll waves. Based on the questions ``Did you smile or laugh a lot yesterday?'', and ``Did you experience the following feelings during A LOT OF THE DAY yesterday? How about Enjoyment?'', ``Did you learn or do something interesting yesterday?''

                        \item \textbf{Negative Affect:} This index calculates the average of negative emotions such as worry, sadness, and anger reported in particular Gallup World Poll waves. Based on the questions ``Did you experience the following feelings during A LOT OF THE DAY yesterday? How about Worry?'', ``Did you experience the following feelings during A LOT OF THE DAY yesterday? How about Sadness?'', and ``Did you experience the following feelings during A LOT OF THE DAY yesterday? How about Anger?''

                \label{fig:du-alcohol-trend-years}
            \end{figure}

            Key insights from the boxplot include:

            \begin{itemize}
                \item \textbf{Peak in 2010:} The mean consumption peaked in the year 2010, with an average of approximately 6.20 liters per capita.

                \item \textbf{General Trend:} Starting from about 6.09 liters in the first year, the mean increased to reach its peak in 2010 and later decreased to below 6.06 liters.

                \item \textbf{Stable Variability:} The size of the boxes, representing the interquartile range (IQR), has remained relatively stable over the years. This indicates that the variability in the data has not seen significant changes.

            \end{itemize}

            The boxplot indicates that there was a temporary increase in alcohol consumption around the year 2010, but this was followed by a decline. The stability of the box sizes suggests that despite fluctuations in the mean, the overall distribution of alcohol consumption has remained relatively constant.

            \figurename~\ref{fig:du-alcohol-distribution} presents a histogram that showcases the distribution of liters of pure alcohol consumed per capita. The data primarily ranges between 0 and about 17 liters, although there are a few instances of consumption reaching approximately 20 liters.

                \label{fig:du-alcohol-distribution}
            \end{figure}

            Key observations from the histogram include:

            \begin{itemize}
                \item \textbf{Peak at Zero:} The histogram peaks just over 0 liters, indicating that a substantial number of data points have near zero alcohol consumption.

                \item \textbf{Main Data Range:} Most of the data is clustered between 0 and approximately 1.5 liters, showing that low levels of alcohol consumption are the most common.

                \item \textbf{Upper Range:} Though the frequencies are low, there are some instances of alcohol consumption reaching around 20 liters.
            \end{itemize}

            The histogram provides an insightful visual representation of alcohol consumption habits. It underscores that while low to moderate alcohol consumption is the norm, there are outliers with substantially higher levels of consumption, which could be of interest for targeted public health initiatives.

            The Global Hunger Index (GHI) functions as an all-encompassing tool to evaluate hunger globally. It combines four indicators to produce a single score, where a higher score indicates deteriorating hunger levels, and a lower score signifies improvement. These indicators encompass undernourishment, child wasting (acute undernutrition), child stunting (chronic undernutrition), and child mortality.
            \\
            \\
            This dataset will serve the purpose of discerning instances where a low percentage is connected to countries with populations that do not experience hunger. This approach is aimed at preventing misinterpretation of results, as countries with low percentages stemming from hunger-related challenges might lead to misguided conclusions regarding crucial variables. Such misinterpretations could potentially distort the genuine patterns and yield inaccurate insights.

            \figurename~\ref{fig:du-smoking-trend-years} provides a combined visual representation of the prevalence of tobacco use among adults over a span of 20 years, from 2000 to 2020. The figure comprises a boxplot as well as a line plot for a more nuanced understanding.

            \begin{figure}[H]
                \centering
                \includegraphics[scale=0.3]{images/du_smoking_pr_sm_y_trend}
                \caption{Trend of prevalence of smoking over years.}
                \label{fig:du-smoking-trend-years}
            \end{figure}

            Key points highlighted by the boxplot and line plot include:

            \begin{itemize}
                \item \textbf{Dramatic Decrease:} The line plot clearly shows that the prevalence of tobacco use among adults has fallen dramatically over the years, from around 30\% in 2000 to just above 20\% in 2020.

                \item \textbf{Year 2000 Outliers:} The boxplot for the year 2000 displays several outliers, indicating that the data was more dispersed during that time.

                \item \textbf{Declining Means:} The means, represented by the center line inside each box, have consistently decreased over the years, which echoes the findings from the line plot.

                \item \textbf{Well-Distributed Data:} The sizes of the boxes remain relatively uniform over the years, suggesting that the data is well-distributed around the mean, despite the overall decline in tobacco use.
            \end{itemize}

            This combined figure provides a comprehensive view of the decreasing trend in tobacco use among adults over the past two decades. The presence of outliers in earlier years and the consistent reduction in mean values emphasize the effectiveness of tobacco control measures over time.


            \figurename~\ref{fig:du-smoking-distribution} shows a histogram outlining the distribution of the prevalence of tobacco use among adults. The data primarily clusters between 4\% and 40\%, with noticeable peaks at around 14\% and 24\%. There are also some rare instances where the prevalence reaches as high as 70\%.

            \begin{figure}[H]
                \centering
                \includegraphics[scale=0.8]{images/du_smoking_pr_sm_freq}
                \caption{Distribution of prevalence of smoking.}
                \label{fig:du-smoking-distribution}
            \end{figure}

            Key insights from the histogram are as follows:

            \begin{itemize}
                \item \textbf{Two Peaks:} The histogram shows two significant peaks, one at around 14\% and another at approximately 24\%, indicating two common levels of adult tobacco use.

                \item \textbf{Main Data Cluster:} The majority of the data is situated between 4\% and 40\%, demonstrating that most countries have moderate levels of adult tobacco use.

                \item \textbf{Rare High Prevalence:} There are a few rare cases where the prevalence of tobacco use spikes to around 70\%.
            \end{itemize}

            The histogram offers a rich visual summary of the varying levels of tobacco use across different countries. It highlights the existence of moderate-to-high levels of tobacco use, and points out that there are a few outlier countries with exceptionally high rates that could be targeted for public health interventions.
